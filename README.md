# Sector Defense
Sector Defense is an open-source tower defense game set in a decaying Dyson swarm. The objective of the game is to defend your sector from waves of enemy attacks by strategically placing towers and using different weapons to destroy them. The game is being developed with the goal of being fun and entertaining for players, and we plan to release it on SteamDeck as well as sell binaries.

# Project Goals

Create an engaging and fun open-source game for players to enjoy.
Release the game on SteamDeck and sell binaries to expand our audience.
Continuously improve and refine the game mechanics based on player feedback.
